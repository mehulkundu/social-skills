# yt-shorts

A Short cut out of a long video is not a clip of the best moment. It is a moment that **survives
without the video around it**, which is a much smaller set.

## Picking

Read the transcript and find spans of 20-55 seconds where all three are true:

1. It opens on a complete thought. If the first sentence needs the previous minute, it is not a Short.
2. There is a turn in it - a claim, then something that complicates or proves it.
3. It ends on a line, not a trail-off.

Rank the candidates and show the user the top five with their timecodes and first line, so they can
reject one without reading the whole transcript.

## Writing each one

- **A NEW first line.** The long video's line assumes context this viewer does not have. Write the
  replacement and run it through `../yt-script/hookscore.py`.
- **On-screen text for the first two seconds**, different words from the spoken line.
- **A loop point**: what the last line sets up so the first line answers it.
- Vertical framing note - what gets cropped out of a 16:9 frame and whether that matters.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**

## Where files live

**Ground rule: one persona, one project.** A persona is one identity: a founder,
a DJ, an artist. Its accounts on Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube are that
persona on different platforms. The format and the style change from platform
to platform, but the persona stays the same, so it never splits into a project
per account. Each platform is a folder inside the persona's project:

```
founder/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── persona.md        # true on every platform: facts, goals, positions, limits
├── story-bank.md     # stories every platform draws from
├── instagram/        # voice.md, profile.md, plan.md, swipe.md, log.md
├── x/
└── linkedin/
```

When a persona starts on a new platform, add a folder to its project. Don't
start a new project for it, and don't copy the persona's facts into the
platform's `voice.md`: that file only says how the persona sounds and what it
posts on that platform.

Paths like `./youtube/voice.md` above mean the platform's folder, found in this
order so one persona's voice never leaks into another's:

0. Whatever the project's `CLAUDE.md` maps this platform to. A project (an
   Obsidian vault, say) can list its own file names for the voice, plan,
   log, swipe file, drafts folder and story bank. Use those exactly.
1. `./youtube/` in the current project, if `./youtube/voice.md` exists.
2. The project root `./`, if `./voice.md` exists and the project's
   `CLAUDE.md` says it is this youtube account (an older one-account repo:
   offer to move it into `./youtube/`).
3. `~/.claude/youtube/` otherwise, as a global default.

Read `./persona.md` before the voice file whenever it exists. On facts, the
persona file wins; on format and style, the platform's `voice.md` wins.
`story-bank.md` lives at the project root and is shared by every platform. If
no voice file exists anywhere, create `./youtube/voice.md` from this plugin's
`templates/voice.md`, and put anything that is true on every platform in
`./persona.md` instead.
