  Read a YouTube Studio audience-retention export and find where viewers
  actually leave, then say what to change. Use for "why do people stop
  watching", "my retention is bad", a pasted retention chart or CSV, or "fix

# yt-retention

The retention graph is the only honest feedback YouTube gives you. Almost nobody exports it.

```bash
python3 retention.py retention.csv --duration 600
python3 retention.py retention.csv --transcript transcript.srt
```

Getting the file: Studio -> a video -> Analytics -> Engagement -> the audience-retention chart ->
the download icon -> "Audience retention".

## Three different problems

- **HOOK LEAK** - what is lost in the first 30 seconds. Under 25% is healthy. This is always the
  first thing to fix and it is always the first fifteen seconds of script, never the edit.
- **CLIFFS** - single steep drops. A cliff is a moment: a topic change with no signposting, a
  sponsor read, a long setup. With `--transcript` the tool prints what was being said there, which
  is what makes the report actionable instead of interesting.
- **SLIDE** - the steady bleed across the middle. A flat slide is pacing. The fix is cutting, not
  rewriting.

## What to hand back

Name the single biggest leak and one change for it. Not a list of five. Then, only if asked, the
rest. And if the hook leak is healthy and the slide is flat, say the video is fine and the problem
is packaging - send them to `/yt-package`.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**

## Where files live

**Ground rule: one persona, one project.** A persona is one identity: a founder,
a DJ, an artist. Its accounts on Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube are that
persona on different platforms. The format and the style change from platform
to platform, but the persona stays the same, so it never splits into a project
per account. Each platform is a folder inside the persona's project:

```
founder/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── persona.md        # true on every platform: facts, goals, positions, limits
├── story-bank.md     # stories every platform draws from
├── instagram/        # voice.md, profile.md, plan.md, swipe.md, log.md
├── x/
└── linkedin/
```

When a persona starts on a new platform, add a folder to its project. Don't
start a new project for it, and don't copy the persona's facts into the
platform's `voice.md`: that file only says how the persona sounds and what it
posts on that platform.

Paths like `./youtube/voice.md` above mean the platform's folder, found in this
order so one persona's voice never leaks into another's:

0. Whatever the project's `CLAUDE.md` maps this platform to. A project (an
   Obsidian vault, say) can list its own file names for the voice, plan,
   log, swipe file, drafts folder and story bank. Use those exactly.
1. `./youtube/` in the current project, if `./youtube/voice.md` exists.
2. The project root `./`, if `./voice.md` exists and the project's
   `CLAUDE.md` says it is this youtube account (an older one-account repo:
   offer to move it into `./youtube/`).
3. `~/.claude/youtube/` otherwise, as a global default.

Read `./persona.md` before the voice file whenever it exists. On facts, the
persona file wins; on format and style, the platform's `voice.md` wins.
`story-bank.md` lives at the project root and is shared by every platform. If
no voice file exists anywhere, create `./youtube/voice.md` from this plugin's
`templates/voice.md`, and put anything that is true on every platform in
`./persona.md` instead.
