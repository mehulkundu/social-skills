description: >-
  Write YouTube chapters from a transcript, validated against YouTube's own
  rules so they actually render. Use for "add chapters", "timestamps",
  "break this video into sections".

## The rules, which are not optional

A chapter list that breaks any of these silently does not become chapters at all - the block just
sits in the description doing nothing:

- The first entry must be **00:00**.
- There must be **at least three**.
- Each must be **at least 10 seconds** long.

The tool checks all three and tells you when a list is invalid rather than letting you paste it.

## Retitle every line

`chapters.py` finds the BOUNDARIES well - it scores the pauses you actually took by how much the
vocabulary shifts across them. The titles it emits are the topic words, and they are a draft. A
chapter called "Thumbnails Titles Packaging" is a placeholder. Rewrite each one as the promise of
that section, in the user's voice, three to five words.

Chapters are also a retention diagnostic: if a section cannot be named in five words, it is two
sections or it is filler.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**

## Where files live

**Ground rule: one persona, one project.** A persona is one identity: a founder,
a DJ, an artist. Its accounts on Instagram, X, LinkedIn and YouTube are that
persona on different platforms. The format and the style change from platform
to platform, but the persona stays the same, so it never splits into a project
per account. Each platform is a folder inside the persona's project:

```
founder/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── persona.md        # true on every platform: facts, goals, positions, limits
├── story-bank.md     # stories every platform draws from
├── instagram/        # voice.md, profile.md, plan.md, swipe.md, log.md
├── x/
└── linkedin/
```

When a persona starts on a new platform, add a folder to its project. Don't
start a new project for it, and don't copy the persona's facts into the
platform's `voice.md`: that file only says how the persona sounds and what it
posts on that platform.

Paths like `./youtube/voice.md` above mean the platform's folder, found in this
order so one persona's voice never leaks into another's:

0. Whatever the project's `CLAUDE.md` maps this platform to. A project (an
   Obsidian vault, say) can list its own file names for the voice, plan,
   log, swipe file, drafts folder and story bank. Use those exactly.
1. `./youtube/` in the current project, if `./youtube/voice.md` exists.
2. The project root `./`, if `./voice.md` exists and the project's
   `CLAUDE.md` says it is this youtube account (an older one-account repo:
   offer to move it into `./youtube/`).
3. `~/.claude/youtube/` otherwise, as a global default.

Read `./persona.md` before the voice file whenever it exists. On facts, the
persona file wins; on format and style, the platform's `voice.md` wins.
`story-bank.md` lives at the project root and is shared by every platform. If
no voice file exists anywhere, create `./youtube/voice.md` from this plugin's
`templates/voice.md`, and put anything that is true on every platform in
`./persona.md` instead.
